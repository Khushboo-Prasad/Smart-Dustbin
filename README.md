# Smart-Dustbin
Smart Dustbin is an automatic dustbin which opens up its lid automatically with the help of a servo motor whever you come near it.

## Usage
It will encourage people to throw the trash inside the dustbin rather than outside as people will find it easy to throw the trash in a dustbin whose lid opens up automaticaly rather than manually opening up the lid of a dustbin and then throwing the trash into it.

In various localities, there are open cap dustbins which invites flies and insects on the garbage and they same roam around our food materials, which can cause serious health issues. This problem can be solved by using smart dustbin.

It is a smart object which can be used to make home clean as samll children will also find it fun to use.

## The Working of Smart Dustbin

For object detection, we are using an ultrasonic sensor which emits ultrasonic waves and receives the waves when it comeback by hitting any object.

Hence whenever anyone comes near the sensor, it detects it and send some signals to aurdino.

Then the aurdino analyzes the data for further processing.

In our case, the range of ultrasonic sensor is 0.5 meters.

On receiving the signals, the servo motor rotates the lid of the dustbin to 90 degree. After 5 seconds, the lid closes automatically.
